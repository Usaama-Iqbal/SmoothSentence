# SmoothSentence
A smooth sentence is one where the last letter of each word is identical to the first letter the following word (and not case sensitive, so "A" would be the same as "a").
This program determines that  whether the input sentence is a smooth sentence, returning a boolean value true if it is, false if it is not.
